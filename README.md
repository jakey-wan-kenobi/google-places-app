Hello, 

Here is a quick demo of a web app with a search box that calls the Places library. There's a lot wrong with it in my opinion given the time limitations, but I think it would prove to be a good start to a pretty decent app. 

I didn't use any frameworks or libraries, just vanilla JS -- given the time limitations and small scope of the project I didn't think it necessary. 

Please note: Chrome blocks geolocation requests when serving your site from file://. I have it running on a local server over here, and I trust you have somebody over there who can do the same!(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5423938/html-5-geo-location-prompt-in-chrome)

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, all the best!

Best, 
Jake
